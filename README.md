# Binary Tree

The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of binary
trees, including their basic operations and implementations in various
use cases. Binary trees are an essential data structure in computer
science, used for storing and organizing data in a hierarchical manner.

One of the most fundamental properties of a binary tree is that each
node can have at most two children, known as the left child and the
right child.


## What is a Binary Tree?

A binary tree is a data structure that is primarily used for data storage.It has the unusual property that each node can only have two children. This property combines the benefits of a sorted array, which allows for fast search operations, and a linked list, which allows for fast insertion and deletion operations.

## Binary Search Tree Representation

A binary search tree follows a specific rule where the value of a node's
left child must be less than the value of its parent, and the value of
the node's right child must be greater than the value of its parent.

However, for tasks 0 to 23 (included) solely deals with simple binary
trees. They are not BSTs, thus they don't follow any kind of rule.
